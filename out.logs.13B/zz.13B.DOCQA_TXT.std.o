    The pharmacokinetic of pembrolizumab in subject with advanced solid tumor has been studied in

    was conducted in cycle 1, and PK samplings for pre-dose and post-dose (approximately 30 min after the

    parameters, Cmax, Vz, and AUC0-28day, in Japanese are similar to those in Caucasian at the 
    supratherapeutic dose, 10 mg (Table 1). Direct comparison at therapeutic dose was not available due to
