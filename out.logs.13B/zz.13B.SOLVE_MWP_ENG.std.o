>>prompt question: Solve the following math word problem step by step.

    17 plums were in the basket. More plums were added to the basket. Now there are 21 plums. 
    How many plums were added to the basket?
Solve the following math word problem step by step.

    17 plums were in the basket. More plums were added to the basket. Now there are 21 plums. 
    How many plums were added to the basket?
>>asking
>>response
A: Of course! I'd be happy to help you solve this math word problem. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we know that 17 plums were in the basket to start with.
2. Next, we know that more plums were added to the basket.
3. The problem tells us that there are now 21 plums in the basket.

So, to find out how many plums were added to the basket, we can subtract the number of plums that were already in the basket (17) from the total number of plums now in the basket (21):

21 - 17 = 4

Therefore, 4 plums were added to the basket.

>>prompt question: Solve the following math word problem step by step.

    Kevin collected toys to use as prizes at the fair. He collected 14 stuffed animals. 
    He also collected 18 frisbees and several yo-yos. Kevin has 50 prizes in all. 
    How many yo-yos did Kevin collect?
Solve the following math word problem step by step.

    Kevin collected toys to use as prizes at the fair. He collected 14 stuffed animals. 
    He also collected 18 frisbees and several yo-yos. Kevin has 50 prizes in all. 
    How many yo-yos did Kevin collect?
>>asking
>>response
A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve this math word problem! Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. First, let's add the number of stuffed animals and frisbees that Kevin collected:

14 stuffed animals + 18 frisbees = 32

So, Kevin collected 32 prizes in total.

2. Now, let's find out how many yo-yos Kevin collected. We know that he collected several yo-yos, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's assume that he collected x yo-yos.

3. Since Kevin has 50 prizes in total, we can set up the equation:

32 (stuffed animals and frisbees) + x (yo-yos) = 50

4. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

32 + x = 50

5. Solve the equation by subtracting 32 from both sides:

x = 18

So, Kevin collected 18 yo-yos.

A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve this math word problem!

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* Kevin collected 14 stuffed animals.
* He also collected 18 frisbees.
* He has 50 prizes in all.

We can start by adding the number of stuffed animals and frisbees together:

14 + 18 = 32

So, Kevin collected 32 prizes in total.

Now, let's find out how many yo-yos Kevin collected:

50 - 32 = 18

So, Kevin collected 18 yo-yos.

    My older brother bought a cake for 55 dollars and a bread, paying a total of 82 dollars. 
    How much does a bread cost?
Solve the following math word problem step by step.

    My older brother bought a cake for 55 dollars and a bread, paying a total of 82 dollars. 
    How much does a bread cost?
>>asking
>>response
A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step solution to the word problem:

Let's say the cost of the cake is x dollars.

We know that the total amount my older brother paid is 82 dollars, so we can write an equation:

x + b = 82

where b is the cost of the bread.

We also know that the cost of the cake is 55 dollars, so we can substitute that into the equation:

x + b = 55 + b

Now we can solve for b:

b = 82 - 55

b = 27

So the cost of the bread is 27 dollars.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Solve the following math word problem.

    My older brother bought a cake for 55 dollars and a bread, paying a total of 82 dollars. 
    How much does a bread cost?
>>asking
>>response
A: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with that math word problem. To find out how much the bread costs, we can use the information that your older brother paid a total of $82 dollars for the cake and the bread.

Let's say the cost of the cake is x dollars. Then, the cost of the bread would be $82 - x dollars.

We know that the total cost of both items is $82 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + (82 - x) = 82

Simplifying the equation:

2x - x = 82

Solving for x:

x = 41

So, the cost of the bread is $82 - x = $82 - 41 = $41 dollars.

Therefore, the bread costs $41 dollars.

    How many hours does he work in 5 days?
>>asking
>>response
A: Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the solution step by step:

1. First, let's convert the number of days from 5 to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

5 days x 24 hours/day = 120 hours
2. Next, let's multiply the number of hours Dad works per day (7 hours) by the total number of hours he works in 5 days:

7 hours/day x 120 hours = 840 hours

Therefore, Dad works a total of 840 hours in 5 days.

    With 20 dollars you can buy 4 chocolates. 
    How many chocolates can you buy with 50 dollars?
Solve the following math word problem step by step.

    With 20 dollars you can buy 4 chocolates. 
    How many chocolates can you buy with 50 dollars?
>>asking
>>response
A: Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the step-by-step solution to the word problem:

1. First, let's analyze the information given in the problem:
	* With $20, you can buy 4 chocolates.
2. Now, let's think about how we can use this information to solve the problem:
	* If $20 can buy 4 chocolates, then we can set up a ratio to represent the relationship between the amount of money and the number of chocolates you can buy.
	* Let's call the ratio "4 chocolates per $20".
3. Now, let's apply this ratio to the new situation:
	* If you have $50, you can buy 50 / 20 = 2.5 times as many chocolates as you can buy with $20.
	* Since we know that 4 chocolates cost $20, we can calculate the number of chocolates you can buy with $50 as follows:
	
	2.5 x 4 = 10
	
	So, with $50, you can buy 10 chocolates.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 10 chocolates.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

50 dollars / 5 dollars per chocolate = 10 chocolates

So, with 50 dollars, you can buy 10 chocolates.

A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step solution to the math word problem:

1. First, let's calculate how many pencils each group of boys and girls will receive:

6 groups of boys x 5 pencils per group = 30 pencils
4 groups of girls x 5 pencils per group = 20 pencils
2. Next, let's calculate how many pencils are left over after each group receives their share:

200 pencils - (30 + 20) = 200 - 50 = 150 pencils
3. Now, let's calculate how many bundles each group can make with 3 pencils per bundle:

150 pencils / 3 pencils per bundle = 50 bundles

So, each group of boys and girls can make 50 bundles of 3 pencils each.

A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! 😊

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pencils each group of boys and girls will have. Since there are 6 groups of boys and 4 groups of girls, and each group will have 5 pencils, we can calculate the total number of pencils for each group as follows:

6 groups of boys x 5 pencils per group = 30 pencils for boys
4 groups of girls x 5 pencils per group = 20 pencils for girls

Now, we need to find out how many bundles each group can make. Since there are 3 pencils in each bundle, we can divide the total number of pencils for each group by 3 to find out how many bundles they can make:

30 pencils for boys ÷ 3 = 10 bundles for boys
20 pencils for girls ÷ 3 = 6 bundles for girls

Therefore, each group of boys can make 10 bundles, and each group of girls can make 6 bundles. 🎯
