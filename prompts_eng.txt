"You need to analyze the sentence step by step according to the following steps and find the number, the corresponding subject, and verb in the sentence <S></S>. Then, output the results in JSON format between <JSON> and </JSON>.
Step 1: Analyze the structure of the sentence. First, find all the numbers described in the sentence, referred to as numerals (NUM). Then, find the measure word (DM) and the noun (ENTITY) that the number describes from the input sentence. Next, find the main verb (VERB) and the main subject (SUBJECT) related to this number. The subject should be a noun or pronoun. If a word of the required part of speech is missing, use # to represent it.
Step 2: Output the analysis result of the first step in JSON format. The keys for the JSON are: (1) NUM is "num"; (2) DM is "dm"; (3) ENTITY is "entity"; (4) SUBJECT is "subject"; (5) VERB is "verb". If there are multiple JSON objects, represent them in a list.
Step 3: Check if the answer is output in JSON format (and includes <JSON> </JSON>).
If the input sentence is, <S>Mary bought 5 apples</S>. You should answer: <JSON>[{"num": "5", "dm": "#","entity": "apple", "verb": "bought", "subject": "Mary"}]</JSON>
If the input sentence is, <S>Mary bought 2.5 apples</S>. You should answer: <JSON>[{"num": "2.5", "dm": "#","entity": "apple", "verb": "bought", "subject": "Mary"}]</JSON>
If the input sentence is, <S>John buys two apples and Mary sells 5 pencils </S>. You should answer: <JSON>[{"num": "two", "dm": "#","entity": "apple", "verb": "buys", "subject": "Mary"}, {"num": "5", "dm": "#","entity": "pencil", "verb": "sell", "subject": "John"}]</JSON>
If the input sentence is, <S>How many apples did you buy</S>. You should answer: <JSON>[{"how many": "#", "dm": "#","entity": "apple", "verb": "buy", "subject": "you"}]</JSON>"
